# M2 - Records CRUD Plan (Completed)

- Goal: implement core records CRUD with UI hooks.
- Delivered:
  - Add/edit/delete flows for types (lab/visit/med/note) with date/title/text/tags.
  - Shared provider refresh for list/detail; soft delete handling.
  - Tests/manual checks logged in TESTING.md.
- Next (handled in later milestones): attachments wiring, extended search/filtering.
