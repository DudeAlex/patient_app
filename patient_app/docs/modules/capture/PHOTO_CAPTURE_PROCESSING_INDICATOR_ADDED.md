# Photo Capture Processing Indicator

- Added UI feedback during photo capture/processing to prevent premature navigation.
- Indicator shows while clarity/processing checks run; disables actions until complete.
- Applies to photo capture flow within capture module; aligns with retake prompts for blurry images.
- Aim: reduce user confusion and incomplete captures; no behavior change to storage/metadata.
