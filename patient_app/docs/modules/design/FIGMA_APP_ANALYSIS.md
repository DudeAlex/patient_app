- Reviewed Figma mobile health concepts: dashboard metrics grid, clean record lists, gradient headers, prominent FABs, simple icons.
- Key takeaways: keep typography legible, maintain generous spacing, emphasize quick actions; limit heavy shadows/animations to protect performance.
- Apply design system components rather than copying raw Figma effects; ensure accessibility and localization flexibility.
