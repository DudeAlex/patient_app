Status: LEGACY

# Figma Design Analysis

- Observations: gradient-heavy headers, rounded cards, minimal text, large icons, clear spacing.
- Strengths: approachable visual language, strong contrast, simple layouts, obvious CTAs.
- Risks: potential performance cost from heavy decorations/animations if mirrored literally; ensure lazy rendering and trimmed shadows.
- Guidance: keep gradients and hierarchy but simplify effects; prioritize accessibility and performance on low-end devices.
