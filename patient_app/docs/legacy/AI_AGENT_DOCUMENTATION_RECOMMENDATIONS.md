# AI Agent Documentation Recommendations (Geo-Reasoner, 2025-11-13)

- Problem: 500+ Obsidian docs, dense mesh, no entry point; hard for AI agents (context limits, navigation, maintenance).
- Recommendations:
  - Add navigation layer: AI_AGENT_START_HERE, CORE_CONCEPTS (20 essentials), ARCHITECTURE_MAP, QUICK_REFERENCE, SEARCH_GUIDE.
  - Identify ~20-30 core docs; tag/core folder; keep glossary; topic READMEs.
  - Organize remaining docs by topic/feature; add archive for historical content.
  - Consider consolidation to 50-100 docs; archive ~250+ historical; summaries for clusters.
  - Track success metrics: time to onboard (<30 min), core doc count, ease of findability.
- Implementation options: quick navigation layer (2-4h), consolidation (1-2 weeks), hybrid (navigation + organized knowledge base).
- Maintenance: quarterly review, archive outdated content, update core docs first, feedback loop when agents struggle.
